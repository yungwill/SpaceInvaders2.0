# SpaceInvadersClone
CSUF CPSC 386 Project: Make Space Invaders from Alien Invasion
Weeks Given to Complete Project: 2 Weeks

Using the Alien Invasion Project as a basis, we were required to make Space Invaders.
All programming was done with no previous experience in Python except what was learned in the CPSC 386 class.

Bugs/Problems/Not Implemented:
  - The aliens move faster than normal
  - The UFO score which appears where UFO is killed is not in the right location
  - Bunkers do not work
